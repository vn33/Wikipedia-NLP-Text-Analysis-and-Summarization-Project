    "        <li><b>Data Collection:</b> We sourced information pertaining to Indian cricket players from Wikipedia, laying the foundation for generating informative summaries.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Text Preprocessing:</b> The acquired data underwent meticulous preprocessing, including tokenization, cleaning, and numerical transformation, to prepare it for summarization.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Text Summarization:</b> Leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF and sentence embeddings, we implemented a text summarization algorithm to distill comprehensive player information into concise summaries.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Evaluation:</b> The efficacy of our summarization efforts was gauged using ROUGE scores, which served as a metric for assessing the similarity between generated and reference summaries.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Visualizations:</b> To gain insights into summarization performance, we crafted visually engaging visualizations showcasing ROUGE scores and other pertinent metrics.</li>\n",
    "        <li><b>Improvements:</b> Throughout the project journey, opportunities for refinement and optimization were identified, including fine-tuning summarization algorithms and exploring advanced NLP models.</li>\n",
